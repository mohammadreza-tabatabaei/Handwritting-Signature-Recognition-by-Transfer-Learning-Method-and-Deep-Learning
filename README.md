# Dataset:
One of these fields contains images of original signatures and the other contains images of forgerie signatures.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
I used vgg16 model by transfer learning technique for this phase.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing original signatures. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.
